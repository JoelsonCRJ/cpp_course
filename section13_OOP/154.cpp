//struct vs classes

//main difference is that struct atributes are public by default
//and class objects attributes are private.
//
//struct for passive objects with public access
//don't declare methods in struct
//
//
//class are used to active objects with private access
//implement getters/setters as needed
//implement member methods as needed
